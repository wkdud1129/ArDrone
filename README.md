Auto-Pilot the Parrot AR.Drone from Python (or Matlab or C)

This repository contains source code for 
building a stubbed version of the AR.Drone AutoPylot program, which allows you to auto-pilot the 
<a href="http://ardrone.parrot.com/parrot-ar-drone/usa/"> Parrot AR.Drone</a> 1.0 or 2.0 
from source code written in Python,  on a computer running 64-bit 
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 16.04.  
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3697dtyOz4">This video</a> gives you an idea of what you can
do with the drone in Python, using this package (see <a href="#greenball">below</a> for instructions).
As the video shows, the update rate is fast enough to enable interesting experiments.
With the AR.Drone 2.0 and my Sony VAIO Pro <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeNTtn231cU">laptop</a>, 
I have obtained update rates of around 30 Hz.

If you're interested in a more graphical-interface approach, you might also look into 
<a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/pages/software/ros-platform">ROS</a>.

<b>Please note that I am only supporting this project on 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.
I do not have the resources to support other OSs.</b>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

To get started, make sure your AR.Drone has the current firmware -- 
easiest way is to download the current version of 
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-flight/id373065271?mt=8">FreeFlight</a> 
from the AppStore.


If you have a 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Extreme-Joystick-Silver-Black/dp/B00009OY9U">
Logitech Extreme 30 Pro joystick</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nyko-Core-Controller-Color-Playstation-3/dp/B003G2Z4FK">
Playstation PS3 controller</a>, the only file you should need to 
modify immediately in the repository is the <b>autopylot.makefile</b>, 
to specify which kind of controller you have and its hexadecimal ID (which
you can find by issuing the <b>lsusb</b> command in Linux).
If you have some other kind of gamepad, like a Nintendo Wii, 
you'll have to modify <b>autopylot_gamepad.c</b> to reflect this.  If you're
using Python, make sure to get the Python development environment:

<pre>
<b>sudo apt-get install python-dev</b> 
</pre>

Depending on what other libraries you already have installed, you may also need to do the following:

<pre>
<b>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev</b>
<p>
<b>sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev</b>
</pre>

<h3>Logitech Joystick Setup</h3>

I set up the program so that the <b>Logitech</b> joystick axes work as follows:



<table border="1">

<tr>

<td><b>Axis</b>

<td><b>Stick</b>

<td><b>Effect</b>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>0</td>

  <td>Rock left/right</td>

  <td>Roll (sideways travel)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>1</td>

  <td>Rock forward/back</td>

  <td>Pitch (forward/backward travel)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>2</td>

  <td>Twist clockwise/anticlockwise</td>

  <td>Yaw (clockwise/anticlockwise turn)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>5</td>

  <td>Mini-joystick on top</td>

  <td>Altitude (forward=down; backward=up)</td>

</tr>

</table>



The <b>Logitech</b> buttons are labeled 1 - 12 on the joystick.  I set up the program to work with them as

follows:



<table border="1">

<tr>

<td><b>Button</b>

<td><b>Effect</b>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>1 (trigger)</td>

  <td>Takeoff/Land</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>2</td>

  <td><b>IN-FLIGHT EMERGENCY CUTOFF</b> </td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>3</td>

  <td>Zap (toggle front/belly camera)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>4</td>

  <td>Toggle autopilot</td>

</tr>

</table>





<a name="PS3"> 

<h3>PS3 Controller Setup</h3>

I set up the program so that the <b>PS3</b> axes work as follows:



<table border="1">

<tr>

<td><b>Axis</b>

<td><b>Stick</b>

<td><b>Effect</b>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>0</td>

  <td>Left-side stick left/right</td>

  <td>Roll (sideways travel)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>1</td>

  <td>Left-side stick forward/back</td>

  <td>Pitch (forward/backward travel)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>2</td>

  <td>Right-side stick left/right</td>

  <td>Yaw (clockwise/anticlockwise turn)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>3</td>

  <td>Right-side stick forward/back</td>

  <td>Altitude (forward=down; backward=up)</td>

</tr>

</table>



I set up the program to work with the <b>PS3</b> buttons as follows:



<table border="1">

<tr>

<td><b>Button</b>

<td><b>Effect</b>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>8 (select)</td>

  <td>Exit program (<b>IN-FLIGHT EMERGENCY CUTOFF</b>)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>9 (start)</td>

  <td>Takeoff/Land</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>3 (square)</td>

  <td>Zap (toggle front/belly camera)</td>

</tr>

<tr>

  <td>2 (&times;) </td>

  <td>Toggle autopilot</td>

</tr>

</table>



These button and axis configurations can be modified by editing <b>gamepad.c</b>


<h3>Running the Default Program</h3>

Change to the repository directory and type <b>make</b>.  This will build the 
<b>ardrone_autopylot</b> executable, as well as compiling the SDK (probably with a lot of warnings about
type mismatches).  Once you've built the program you can run it by typing
<b>./ardrone_autopylot</b> in the directory where 
you built it.  The <b>autopylot.makefile</b> is set up to use Python, but you can modify it for Matlab or C.

The autopilot is intially off, so you are flying the AR.Drone
manually. When you push the autopilot button (4 on the Logitech joystick,
&times; on the PS3), control is transferred to the 
<b>action</b> function in 
<b>autopylot_agent.py</b>.  Any subsequent joystick / gamepad action returns control to you, providing an 
emergency override.  The function in <b>autopylot_agent.py</b> currently ignores the video and navigation data 
input and just makes the drone turn clockwise.  (I've noticed that the program can take several
seconds to report non-zero navigation data from the drone.)  Note that the altitude and X/Y velocities
are approixmate, and that the minimum reported altitude is around 230 mm.
You can modify this function to do something
more interesting.

<h3>Working with ROS</h3>

Thanks to [Alesolano](https://github.com/alesolano), ARDroneAutoPylot can now work with [rospy](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy), the Python client for the popular [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) platform. Get Ale's solution [here](https://github.com/simondlevy/ARDroneAutoPylot/issues/1#issuecomment-371462385).

<a name="matlab">

<h3>Working with Matlab</h3>

The file <b>autopylot_agent.m</b> contains Matlab code equivalent to the
Python code in <b>autopylot_agent.py</b>.
To run the Matlab version, comment-out the Python lines
(36-38) in autopylot.makefile, and un-comment the Matlab lines (45-47).
you should have the following in your <b>.bashrc</b> file:

<pre>

<b>

export MATLAB=/usr/local/MATLAB/R2013a # or whatever release you've installed



export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MATLAB/bin/glnxa64

</b></pre>

You will also need the <tt><b>csh</b></tt> command,
which is used by the Matlab Engine.  To be sure you have this command,
do <tt><b>sudo apt-get install csh</b></tt> in your Ubuntu shell.



<a name="matlab">

<h3>Working with C</h3>

If you prefer to program in C, comment-out the Python lines in
autopylot.makefile, un-comment the C lines (50-51), and work with the code
in <b>autopylot_c_agent.c</b>. 



<a name="greenball">

<h3>Running the Ball-Tracking Example</h3>

To run the example in the video, download 
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/OpenCV-Python-Hacks/blob/master/greenball_tracker.py">greenball_tracker.py</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/ARDroneAutoPylot/blob/master/opencv/autopylot_agent.py">this</a> 
version of <b>autopylot_agent.py</b>. You will need OpenCV for Python, 
which you can install by following the instructions
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV">here</a>.
